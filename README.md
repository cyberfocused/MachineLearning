##Machine Learning
## A simple open notebook in Jupyter where I taught the app to analyze data from my Excel file spreadsheet of people aged from 20- 25 years old and genres of music that each group 
  preferred to listen to: 1's represented Adult males and 0's represented Adult females

## Step #1 - from my open notebook on Jupyter

## Step #2 - I split the data into 2 columns-input and output

## Step #3 - a temporary inspection of my music database

## Step #4 - I tested to see what music genres a 21 year old male and 22 year old female would listen to since they aren't listed in my database

## Step #5 - I set a test size to 20%- for training the machine

## Step #6 - I set the test size to be used for training to 80% for testing
